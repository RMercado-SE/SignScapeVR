# SignScapeVR

Overview
This project is a Unity-based application that integrates hand tracking technology using MediaPipe and OpenCV to facilitate the learning and practice of British Sign Language (BSL) fingerspelling. The application provides real-time hand tracking, gesture recognition, and interactive practice sessions designed to help users improve their BSL skills.

Features
Hand Tracking: Utilizes MediaPipe via a Python backend to track hand movements and key points in real-time.
BSL Fingerspelling Recognition: Detects and provides feedback on fingerspelling gestures, helping users practice and improve their skills.
Practice Sessions: Includes interactive practice modes with visual, auditory, and haptic feedback to reinforce learning.
Seamless Unity-Python Integration: Establishes a connection between Unity and a Python script to handle the heavy lifting of hand tracking.
Customizable UI: Allows users to interact with and visualize hand movements through a user-friendly interface.
